    "Which of the following statements are true?\n",
    "\n",
    "- You cannot be certain at what point of time garbage collection will occur [x]\n",
    "- An object without reference will be immediately garbage collected []\n",
    "- An object will be eligible for garbage collection after the execution of the method is over [x]\n",
    "- Garbage collection ensures programs will never run out of memory []\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation :\n",
    "Once an object is not needed, it will be subject to garbage collection but you cannot be certain at what point of time will garbage collection happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation :\n",
    "A reference variable will be removed from the stack as soon as the method finishes execution. If this reference was referring to an object, that object becomes eligible for garbage collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2 of 6**\n",
    "\n",
    "How many objects and references have been created in the scenario given below?\n",

    "- objects: 4, references: 3 []\n",
    "- objects: 2, references: 4 [x] \n",
    "- objects: 2, references: 3 []\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation :\n",
    "\n",
    "An object is created using the new keyword. Thus, there are 2 objects created in the given code initially referenced by student1 and student2.\n",
    "\n",
    "A reference variable is the one which can be used to access an object and can have null value. There are 4 reference variables in the given code namely student1, student2, student3 and student4.\n",

    "**Q3 of 6**\n",

    "- 0 []\n",
    "- compilation error []\n",
    "- runtime error [x]\n",
    "- null []\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation :\n",
    "\n",
    "The code will throw a runtime exception since the reference variable trainee is set to null and is used in accessing the instance variable id.\n",
