/**
 * The Point class is used for representing a point with two coordinates.
 * Implement the class Point based on the class diagram and description given below.
 * Method Description
 * Point(double xCoordinate , double yCoordinate )
 * Initialize the instance variables xCoordinate and yCoordinate appropriately with the values passed to the constructor.
 * calculateDistance()
 * Calculate and return the distance of the point from the origin (0,0). The distance can be calculated using the
 *  formula given below. The distance should be rounded off to 2 decimal digits.
 * distance=âˆš((x2-x1)2+(y2-y1)2), where x1 and x2 are values of x-coordinates of two points and y1 and y2 are values 
 * of y-coordinates of two points
 * calculateDistance(Point point)
 * Calculate and return the distance of the point from the 'point' passed to the method. 
 * The distance should be rounded off to 2 decimal digits.
 * Hints
 * Use Math.sqrt(double d) method to calculate the square root
 * Use Math.round(double d) method to round off the values
 * Implement the getter and setter methods appropriately.
 * Test the functionalities using the provided Tester class. 
 * Sample Input and Output
 * Input
 * Point object - point1
 * Instance variables   Values
 * xCoordinate          3.5
 * yCoordinate          1.5
 * 
 * Point object - point2
 * Instance variables   Values
 * xCoordinate          6
 * yCoordinate          4
 * 
 * Output
 * Distance of point1 from origin: 3.81
 * Distance of point2 from origin: 7.21
 * Distance of point1 from point2: 3.54
