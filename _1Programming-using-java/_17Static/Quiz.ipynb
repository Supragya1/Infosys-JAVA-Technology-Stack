    "Instance variables are the ones that are declared inside a class. Static variables are the ones that are declared inside a class with static keyword. Local variables are the ones which are declared inside a method or a constructor, even parameters are local variables.\n",
    "Here, numberOfCars is a static variable, vehicleNumber and color are instance variables and there are 2 parameters in the constructor and 1 parameter in the display() method, so there are 3 local variables.\n",

    "Explanation :\n",
    "static members are accessed using the class name and without any object reference. So, it is true that static members can be accessed without creating a single object.\n",
